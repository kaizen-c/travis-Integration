[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/kaizen-c/travis-Integration/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=R6ASQTXUTE)](https://codecov.io/gh/kaizen-c/travis-Integration)

This Project is used to demonstrate how to integrate Travis-CI, CodeCov, GitHub and Heroku.

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/): To push the code and trigger the Travis CI.
2. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/): To run the tests and build the code for production.
3. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/): To deploy the code automatically once the tests/build is passed successfully.
4. [CodeCov](https://codecov.io/):To measure the test coverage of your codebase

## Prerequisites

Apart from having accounts created in above mentioned applications you will also have to make integrations between 

Travis-CI and Github and for that do check following [documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/#to-get-started-with-travis-ci-using-github). 

next step is to use CodeCov with travis-Ci and a great tutorial could be found [here](https://dev.to/j0nimost/using-codecov-with-travis-ci-pytest-cov-1dfj).

Here i have used python to build up a simple web application using Flask. This will expose an endpoint where you will be able to get the consolidated results of two web URI's.

Here you can see how all integrations work (except CodeCov).
